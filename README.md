# Object-Tracking-PyTorch-YOLOv5-DeepSort
This repo represents implimentation of YOLOv5 and DeepSort in Pytorch for object tracking
The detections generated by YOLOv5, a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, are passed to a Deep Sort algorithm which combines motion and appearance information based on OSNet in order to tracks the objects. It can track any object that your Yolov5 model was trained to detect.
